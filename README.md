A step-by-step guide on how to install custom firmware and ubuntu to your chromebook.


<h2>So, I was thinking earlier "what's the best way to unenroll a chromebook?" and then it hit me. Why not install a different OS? So that's what this is for. (I'm lying a little bit, but we all have to lie to get around in life.)</h2>

<h1>Part 1: Unenrollment</h1>

<h2>The first part of this is unenrolling your chromebook, to access developer mode.</h2>

<h4>Step 1: Download a prebuilt shim for your board, here: https://github.com/ading2210/sh1mmer/actions/runs/16721214945</h4>
<h4>Step 2: Flash the shim to your USB using CRU or any other tool (BalenaEtcher is one you can use, and you <em><strong>WILL</em></strong> need it for the rest of this.</h4>
<h4>Step 3: After the shim is finished, SAFELY remove it from your computer and enter recovery mode on your chromebook.</h4>
<h4>Step 4: Once in recovery mode, press CTRL + D and confirm that you want to enter developer mode (doesn't matter if it's blocked, if you can run shims, you're good.)</h4>
<h4>Step 5: Insert the flashed USB into your chromebook, and let it work its magic.</h4>
<h4>Step 6: Once you're in the SH1MMER screen, click Payloads, then Br0ker.</h4>
<h4>Step 7: Let it do its thing, then press enter to reboot.</h4>
